numsList = [7, 6, 23, 8.18, 18, 8, 7.2, 85, 915, 12]

###################### Same Start and End ######################
stringsList = ["abc", "123", "2332", "aBBA", "heelloo", "1212", "DcEfD"]
print([string for string in filter(lambda x: x[0].lower() == x[-1].lower(), stringsList)])
# I use list comprehension because this is the simplest and fastest way to do this.
# Conclusion: for each element in stringsList, filter the string that has the same beginning (which is string[0]) and ending (which is string[-1]) and store them to a new list (the list is temporary -- it is in the print() function)
# The `lambda x: x[0].lower() == x[-1].lower()`, which is a lambda expression, defines an anonymous function, which compares the beginning and the ending and outputs the result, in order to maximizly simplify the code

# This method is quite complicated so I fully commented it, but it uses all lists without dictionary to solve this problem.
# I prefer to use collections.Counter() method to solve this problem.
